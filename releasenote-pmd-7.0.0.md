After a long time, we’re excited to bring you now the next major version of PMD!

Since this is a big release, we provide here only a concise version of the release notes. We prepared a separate page with the full [Detailed Release Notes for PMD 7.0.0](https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-7.0.0/pmd_release_notes_pmd7.html).

Many thanks to all users and contributors who were testing the release candidates and provided feedback and/or PRs!
